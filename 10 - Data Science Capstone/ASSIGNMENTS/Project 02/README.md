# Final Project Submission

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny that provides a 
user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the ui.R and server.R source code files for the developed Shiny application as well as the RStudio Presenter files. <br />
The Shiny application is hosted on shinyapps.io and the Presentation (slides) are available on RPubs.
