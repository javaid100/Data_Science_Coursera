```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Directions

A box plot and scatter plot showing the cereals ratings based on manufacturer and sugar content.

- Click a box plot to show only that manufacturer in the scatter plot.
- Double click to reset.
- Hover over the point to see specific info.

## Cereals

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(crosstalk)
library(plotly)
library(plyr)
cereal <- read.csv("cereal.csv")
cereal <- cereal[,c(1,2,10,16)]
names(cereal) <- c("Name","Manufacturer","Sugar","Rating")
cereal$Name <- as.character(cereal$Name)
cereal$Rating <- round(cereal$Rating,digits=2)
cereal[cereal$Sugar == -1,'Sugar'] <- 1
cereal$Manufacturer <- mapvalues(cereal$Manufacturer, from = c("A", "G","K","N","P","Q","R"), to = c("American Home", "General Mills","Kelloggs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker Oats","Ralston Purina"))
m <- SharedData$new(cereal, ~Name)
p1 <- ggplot(m, aes(x= Manufacturer, y= Rating, fill = Manufacturer)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_x_discrete(labels = c("A", "G","K","N","P","Q","R"))
p2 <- ggplot(m, aes(Sugar, Rating, fill = Manufacturer)) + geom_point(aes(size = 1.5))
subplot(p1, p2) %>% highlight("plotly_click", off = "plotly_doubleclick") %>% hide_legend()
```
